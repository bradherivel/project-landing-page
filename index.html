                            <p>This is placeholder text. I need to replace it by writing a brief description of SSK
                            paws business, what it stands for, what services it offers etc. It doesn't need to be too long, around
                            a standard paragraph. I am intensionally making this longer than it needs to be so that it is easy to 
                            read on the screen & therefore making it easier for me to place around in flexbox.

    <p>This is an inpiring quote, or a testimonial from a customer. Maybe it's just filling up space,
        or maybe people will actually read it. Who knows? All i know is that it looks nice.
